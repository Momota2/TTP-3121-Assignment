  We begin with the installation of git in our computer. Then we follow the guideline in the MMLS and register a GitHub account and create new repository. We then install oracle vmware in our computer and install ubuntu in the vmware. After that, We study about popen function and also string tokenizer function. After understanding the functions, we begin the developement of code by refering the sample. Then we start to create the readme document which describe the tasks that we have done.
Basically, all of the task we carried out together during assignment meeting, so most of the tasks are done together.
